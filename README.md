# LeetCode Solutions 🚀

This repository contains my personal solutions to various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems, written in Python. Each file is named after the problem it solves, keeping the structure simple and flat for easy navigation.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- Each `.py` file in the root directory corresponds to a single LeetCode problem.
- File names follow the format: `problem_name.py` (e.g., `valid_sudoku.py`, `two_sum.py`).
- Solutions are implemented in **plain Python**, with no external dependencies.

---

## ✅ Goals

- Practice and improve problem-solving and algorithmic skills.
- Build a public portfolio of clean, readable code.
- Track progress over time.

---

## 🚀 Running Solutions

- There is an example at the end of each file you can uncomment them for test
- You can run any solution using:

```bash
python <filename>.py
